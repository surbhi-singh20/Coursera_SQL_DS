Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =10000 
ii. Business table =10000 
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000 
v. elite_years table =10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table =10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table =10000 


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =10000 (PK)
ii. Hours =1562(FK business_id)
iii. Category =2643(FK business_id)
iv. Attribute =1115(FK business_id)
v. Review =8090(FK business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493(FK business_id)
vii. Photo =6493(FK business_id)
viii. Tip = 3979(FK business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (PK)

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
City: Mesa        Category: Food 
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
                Yes
	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Based on the results, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 
SQL code used for analysis:
select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
 group by business.stars;


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
i. Difference 1:
		Business which are still open has more reviews than business which has been closed.
SQL code used for analysis:

select review_count from business where is_open=1 order by review_count desc.
+--------------+
| review_count |
+--------------+
|         3873 |
select review_count from business where is_open=0 order by review_count desc.
+--------------+
| review_count |
+--------------+
|          700 |

        ii. Difference 2:
         Business which are  open has greater latitude than business which has been closed.
SQL code used for analysis:

select latitude from business where  is_open=1 order by latitude desc.
+----------+
| latitude |
+----------+
|  89.9993 |
select latitude from business where  is_open=0 order by latitude desc
+----------+
| latitude |
+----------+
|  57.4763 |


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         Finding business which is open and has category as 'Food'.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
       Relations used here are Business and Category.
       Columns which is used for analysis are category and is_open.I used join to combine two relations and found out the desired results.             
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
